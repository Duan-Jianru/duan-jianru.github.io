- In 2022, I co-founded a student-run café called **Café Obtus (钝角咖啡)** in Building 21 at Peking University ([link](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CsXiT3ZWsTkdJ12gDyrQrw)). The café has been well-received by students and faculty in the department. As a special offer, we provide a 25% discount to any guest who has won one of the following awards: the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize, or the Abel Prize. So far, two guests have enjoyed this discount!
- I have a long-standing passion for **billiards**, including Chinese Eight-ball and Snooker. As a member of Peking University’s billiards team and captain of the School of Mathematical Sciences team, together with my teammates, we achieved a "Grand Slam" by winning the university’s Freshman Cup, Graduate Cup, and Peking University Cup (here is a [photo](/billiard.jpg) of me concentrating on a pot).
- Other hobbies include: photography, bouldering...
